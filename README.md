# About this Repository
AtScale's semantic layer platform simplifies the access to data through a unified, business-friendly interface, allowing users with varying levels of technical expertise to understand and analyze data without needing to know complex query languages or database structures. This accessibility leads to better, faster decision-making across all levels of an organization. Moreover, by standardizing definitions and metrics, a semantic layer ensures consistency and accuracy in reporting and analytics, reducing errors and misinterpretations.

This repository contains a variety of semantic models encoded in the **S**emantic **M**odeling **L**anguage (SML).

# Model Library

## Tutorial Models
1. [Internet Sales](models/tutorials/internet-sales) - a simple, single fact model derived from the ficticious AdventureWorks retail dataset.
2. [World Wide Importers](models/tutorials/world-wide-importers) - a more complex, multi-fact model that represents a fictional wholesale and distribution company.
3. [TPC-DS](models/tutorials/tpc-ds) - a complex, multi-fact model that encodes the [TPC-DS](https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/) benchmark model in SML.

### How to Load to Tutorial Data into BigQuery

1. Create a project named `atscale-tutorial-data` in BigQuery
2. In the BigQuery console for the `atscale-tutorial-data` project, run the following DDL scripts in this [directory](data/loaders/bigquery):
	1. [`load-as-adventure.sql`](data/loaders/bigquery/load-as_adventure.sql)
	2. [`load-ww-importers.sql`](data/loaders/bigquery/load-ww-importers.sql)
	3. [`load-tpcds.sql`](data/loaders/bigquery/load-tpcds.sql)

## Creating an AtScale Connection to your Own Data

1. **Go to AtScale Settings:** In AtScale Design Center, click on the "Settings" dropdown by clicking on the AtScale logo icon (upper left).

![AtScale-Design-Center-Settings](images/AtScale-Design-Center-Settings.png)

2. **Create a Data Warehouse:** In Settings, click on the "Data Warehouse" option (top left) and click on the icon (right) for the data platform you wish to connect (i.e. BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.).

![AtScale Design Center Add Connection](images/AtScale-Design-Center-Add-Snowflake.png)

2. **Enter Data Warehouse Information:** In the Data Warehouse property panel, enter your information and click on the "Apply" button. **Note that you may need to create a new database and schema to hold AtScale's aggregate tables.**

![AtScale Design Center Add DW Properties](images/AtScale-Design-Center-DW-Properties.png)

3. **Create a Data Warehouse Connection:** After creating the data warehouse, create a connection by clicking on the down arrow on the data warehouse your just created and click on the "Add Connection +" button.

![AtScale Design Center Add DW Connection](images/AtScale-Design-Center-DW-Connection.png)

4. **Enter Data Warehouse Connection Information:** In the Data Warehouse Connection property panel, enter your information and click on the "Test" button to make sure that the connection information is valid. Then click on the "Apply" button. 

**SPECIAL NOTE for a Databricks:** Fill in the "Extra JDBC Flags" field with the folowing information you can get from your data wareouse/cluster's "Connection Details" tab in the Databricks console: `transportMode=http;ssl=1;AuthMech=3;httpPath=<YOUR HTTP PATH>`. Also, for the "Username" field enter a value of "token" and enter your Databricks Personal Access Token into the "Password" field.

5. **Change your SML Connection:** Go back to the Repo Browser by clicking on the AtScale icon (upper left corner) and update each model's connection YML file's `as_connection` property to to same string (i.e. "Snowflake") you entered into "External connection ID" field in the Data Warehouse Connection property panel in step 3. Make sure to click on the "Save File" button at the bottom of the text editor.

**SPECIAL NOTE for BigQuery:** You may also need to change the `database` property to `atscale-tutorial-data` (note the dashes rather than underscores).
