# About this Repository
AtScale's semantic layer platform simplifies the access to data through a unified, business-friendly interface, allowing users with varying levels of technical expertise to understand and analyze data without needing to know complex query languages or database structures. This accessibility leads to better, faster decision-making across all levels of an organization. Moreover, by standardizing definitions and metrics, a semantic layer ensures consistency and accuracy in reporting and analytics, reducing errors and misinterpretations.

This repository contains a variety of semantic models encoded in the **S**emantic **M**odeling **L**anguage (SML).
